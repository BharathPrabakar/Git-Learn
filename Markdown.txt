In git we use README.md file, inorder to provide overall discription of the repo.
In that 'README.md' we can see "md" as its language, where 'md' means MarkDown.
MarkDown is a language.
It is similer to HTML.

Let's dive into functionalities of MarkDown:

MarkDown
    Heading's
    Paragraph
    List
    Tables
    Codes
    Highlights

Heading's
    Similer to HTML , in md also we have heading symbols(like tags).
    in HTML we use '<h>' tag where in md we use '#' symbol
    In HTML we have h1 to h6, same as that we have # to ######, which will have different size.

Eg: 

#Topic - similer to <h1>Topic</h1>
##sub-topic - similer to <h2>sub-topic</h2>


Paragraph
    In MarkDown at max we can give only one space between characters.
    If you type with more than one space , it will display only on space.
    in HTML <pre/> tag will display the content as same as given, in order to have the same in 'md' we should give one tab space before each line.



List
    List is of Two type:
        Ordered List
        Un-Ordered List
    
    Ordered List
        In order to declare a Ordered list do: 1.(space)(content)
        Further lines will be automatically declared, on giving enter.

    Nested Ordered List
        In order to declare a Nested Ordered List , after declaring initial OL, do: (tab)1.(space)(content)
    
Eg:

1.(space)Veg
(tab)1.(space)fruits
     2. //further numbers will be automatically declared
    

    Un-Ordered List
        In order to declare a Ordered list do: -(space)(content)
        Further lines will be automatically declared, on giveing enter.
    
    Nested Un-Ordered List
        In order to declare a Nested Un-Ordered List , after declaring initial UOL, do: (tab)-(space)(content)
    
Eg:

- Initial_UOL
    - Nested_UOL
    - //further will automatically declared on giving next.



Tables

    In order to create table format in 'md', we use pipe( | ) operator and minus( - ).
    On every line first and last should be with pipe operator.
    for dividing heading with a horizantal line , use ( - ).

Eg:

|Heading1|Heading2|Heading3|
|--------|--------|--------|
|constent|constent|constent|
|constent|constent|constent|
|constent|constent|constent|

this will provide table format.



Codes

    In order to write codes inside the 'md' file we use backtick.
    If we are writting C code in the md file, we should start by defining ( ```C ) at the bigining and ( ``` ) at the end.

Eg:

```C
#include<stdio.h>
int main() {
    printf("This is C code");
    return 0;
}
```



Highlights

    To make a letter or word or Line BOLD we should use ( ** ) at the start and end.
    To make a letter or word or Line Italic we should use ( * ) at the start and end.
    To have both Italic and Bold , we use ( *** )

Eg:

**Bold**
*italic*
***Both Bold and Italic***
